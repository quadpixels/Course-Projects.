(CNN) -- The first lawsuit in a child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky was filed Wednesday on behalf of a person listed in the complaint as "John Doe A" and says the alleged victim was 10-years-old when he first met Penn State's former defensive coordinator.
Attorneys Jeff Anderson and Marci Hamilton said Sandusky sexually abused the alleged victim "over one hundred times" and threatened to harm the victim and his family if he alerted anyone.
Anderson said Sandusky also showered the alleged victim with "gifts, travel, and privileges" while attending The Second Mile camp, a nonprofit organization Sandusky founded for underprivileged children.
The filing targets that organization, Sandusky and Penn State University, pointing to what it describes as an "institutional concealment" and "institutional failure" which allowed the former coach to "thrive and prosper."
Sandusky allegedly molested multiple victims dating back to the 1970s, according to the lawsuit.
Anderson told reporters that the alleged victim, now 29, has come forward with the allegations in an effort to protect other potential victims.
"I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times, at all kinds of places, until the newspapers" reported the alleged abuse, Anderson quoted the alleged victim as saying in a written statement.
"I am hurting and have been for a long time," he said.
Sandusky, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence. His attorney, Joe Amendola, said Monday that he is working with a private investigator in his quest to prove his innocence.
Sandusky, 67, is free on $100,000 bail. He is charged with 40 counts related to the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys. He allegedly met the victims through The Second Mile.
Penn State, meanwhile, is expected hold a town hall forum Wednesday where students can ask questions about the child sex scandal that has shaken the campus.
University President Rodney Erickson and several campus student organizations will host the event Wednesday night.
"We all have questions," representatives of three campus groups wrote in a statement about the forum. " President Erickson is committed to making this healing process a community effort. As the University moves forward, there is a critical need for the student body and administration to have a dialogue about our plan for the future."
Sandusky, the longtime Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator, told NBC's Bob Costas that he has been falsely accused and that he only horsed around" with kids in showers after workouts. Amendola also says Sandusky is innocent.
Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, 57, and the school's vice president for finance and business, Gary Schultz, 62, were each charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations about Sandusky. Their preliminary court hearing is set for December 16 at the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg.
In addition, Penn State President Graham Spanier and iconic head football coach Joe Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest, following criticism that the football program and university in general did not adequately handle the matter when allegations arose years earlier.
Several other people also have come forward, saying they too were sexually abused by Sandusky.CNN) -- The first lawsuit in a child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky was filed Wednesday on behalf of a person listed in the complaint as "John Doe A" and says the alleged victim was 10-years-old when he first met Penn State's former defensive coordinator.

The filing targets that organization, Sandusky and Penn State University, pointing to what it describes as an "institutional concealment" and "institutional failure" which allowed the former coach to "thrive and prosper."
Sandusky allegedly molested multiple victims dating back to the 1970s, according to the lawsuit.
Anderson told reporters that the alleged victim, now 29, has come forward with the allegations in an effort to protect other potential victims.
"I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times, at all kinds of places, until the newspapers" reported the alleged abuse, Anderson quoted the alleged victim as saying in a written statement.
"I am hurting and have been for a long time," he said.
Sandusky, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence. His attorney, Joe Amendola, said Monday that he is working with a private investigator in his quest to prove his innocence.

Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, 57, and the school's vice president for finance and business, Gary Schultz, 62, were each charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations about Sandusky. Their preliminary court hearing is set for December 16 at the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg.
In addition, Penn State President Graham Spanier and iconic head football coach Joe Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest, following criticism that the football program and university in general did not adequately handle the matter when allegations arose years earlier.
Several other people also have come forward, saying they too were sexually abused by Sandusky.CNN) -- The first lawsuit in a child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky was filed Wednesday on behalf of a person listed in the complaint as "John Doe A" and says the alleged victim was 10-years-old when he first met Penn State's former defensive coordinator.
Attorneys Jeff Anderson and Marci Hamilton said Sandusky sexually abused the alleged victim "over one hundred times" and threatened to harm the victim and his family if he alerted anyone.
Anderson said Sandusky also showered the alleged victim with "gifts, travel, and privileges" while attending The Second Mile camp, a nonprofit organization Sandusky founded for underprivileged children.
The filing targets that organization, Sandusky and Penn State University, pointing to what it describes as an "institutional concealment" and "institutional failure" which allowed the former coach to "thrive and prosper."
Sandusky allegedly molested multiple victims dating back to the 1970s, according to the lawsuit.
Anderson told reporters that the alleged victim, now 29, has come forward with the allegations in an effort to protect other potential victims.
"I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times, at all kinds of places, until the newspapers" reported the alleged abuse, Anderson quoted the alleged victim as saying in a written statement.
"I am hurting and have been for a long time," he said.
Sandusky, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence. His attorney, Joe Amendola, said Monday that he is working with a private investigator in his quest to prove his innocence.
Sandusky, 67, is free on $100,000 bail. He is charged with 40 counts related to the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys. He allegedly met the victims through The Second Mile.
Penn State, meanwhile, is expected hold a town hall forum Wednesday where students can ask questions about the child sex scandal that has shaken the campus.
University President Rodney Erickson and several campus student organizations will host the event Wednesday night.
"We all have questions," representatives of three campus groups wrote in a statement about the forum. " President Erickson is committed to making this healing process a community effort. As the University moves forward, there is a critical need for the student body and administration to have a dialogue about our plan for the future."
Sandusky, the longtime Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator, told NBC's Bob Costas that he has been falsely accused and that he only horsed around" with kids in showers after workouts. Amendola also says Sandusky is innocent.
